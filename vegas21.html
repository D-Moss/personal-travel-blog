				After being picked up at the hotel in an air-conditioned van, we embarked on an unforgettable adventure. The ride was comfortable and coll, setting a perfect tone for the rest of the evening. As we journeyed through scenic landscapes, the excitement for the upcoming horseback grew with each passing moment.

				Upon arriving at the ranch, we were greeted warmly by the staff and introduced to a group of well-trained horses. We saddled up and began out 1 hour and 30 minute horseback ride just as the sun had started to set. The timing couldn't have been more perfect, with the golden hues of the sunset casting a magical glow over the landscape. The beautiful scenery made every moment on horseback feel like a dream come ture.

				As the ride came to a close, we were treated to a delicious meal that exceeded all expectations. The grilled chicked was perfectly cooked, and the sides of corn on the cob and a baked potato were absolutely mouthwatering. Sharing this meal in such a serene setting added to the overall sense of peace and contentment.

				After dinner, we had the chance to gaze at the unobstructed view of the stars. With no city lights to dim the night sky, the stars shone brilliantly, creating a mesmerizing backdrop. It was a breathtaking sight that left everyone in awe and provided the perfect ending to the evening.

				<br><br>

				Finally, we were dropped off back at our hotel, filled with wonderful memories of the adventure.
